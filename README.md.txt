# SQL Reporting and Data Transformation Projects

This repository contains SQL-based data reporting and transformation projects completed as part of my Bachelor of Science in Data Analytics program at Western Governors University (WGU). These projects demonstrate my ability to design relational schemas, write complex queries, implement transformations, and create reusable database objects to support business reporting.

The focus of this work is on practical SQL skills used in a data analyst role, including data aggregation, joins, views, triggers, and stored procedures.
